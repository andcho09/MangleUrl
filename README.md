# URL Mangler

VS Code extension that formats highlighted URLs in the text editor.


## Features

<img src="doc/demo.gif"/>

**Recognises URLs for**:

* Confluence
* GitLab URLs
* Javadoc URLs (handling triggers when the url contains 'javadoc')
* JIRA
* SharePoint URLs
* And can be used on other sites. YMMV.

**Detection of**:

* URL fragments which link to a section within the page. The section title is extracted as part of the display name.

**Extracts display names to the following formats**:

|Format|Pattern|Comments|
|------|-------|--------|
|Display name only|``{display name}``|Extracts just the display name only without the URL|
|HTML href|``<a href="{display name}">{url}</a>``|Extracts as a HTML ``<a>`` anchor tag. Note this is plain text, not text/html. See [Known Issues](#known-issues) section below. |
|JIRA text syntax|``[{display name}\|{url}]``|Extracts to JIRA's text syntax|
|Markdown|``[{display name}]({url})``|Extracts to Markdown syntax|


## Known Issues

### HTML href output

The HTML href output format updates the clipboard with ``text/plain`` content. This should be ``text/html`` but [VS Code's Clipboard API](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#Clipboard) only allows you to write plain text. This could change if issue [141704](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/141704) is accepted although [163240](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/163240) was closed because of [incomplete browser compatibility for Clipboard#write](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Clipboard/write).
